# mini-player-module
Minimalist recreation of Roblox's Player Module alongside the old Roblox Camera types.   
*This is the server authorative branch of the player module!!*   

## Info
This version of the player module runs significantly faster than Roblox's current Player Module, but that also means some features might be missing as a result. However, this project is meant to be built upon with other custom logic.
